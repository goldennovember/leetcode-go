Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any **order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```sql  
Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |

+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |

| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
